Dear colleagues,

In the context of IROS 2021 will be held the Second Workshop on Robotic Manipulation of Deformable Objects in Real-World Applications (RoMaDO-RA). It tackles the problem of manipulating soft objects, whose deformations require specific contributions in terms of modeling, control, perception and planning. More information can be found on the website: https://adkoessler.github.io/romadora-workshop/

Due to the online nature of the workshop and the specificities of IROS 2021 in terms of organization, multiple live sessions and on-demand materials will coexist. Please find here a summary.

====== Live session #1 =======

September 14, 14:00 CEST on Teams (free attendance, no IROS registration needed)
